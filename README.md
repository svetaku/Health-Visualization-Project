## Health Data Visualization

### About the project
In this project, I took two health journals of one patient and superimposed them in order to try and find any visual correlation. \
The first dataset is a migraine journal where the patient was logging days with and without headache, as well as the headache intentsity. \
The second dataset is a period journal, where the patient was logging their period and ovulation dates. \
Both journals span a period of 525 days.

### Code
This project contains a single notebook, divided into three parts:
1. Loading the data - loading the .csv datasets and and merging them into one.
2. Preparing the data - creating functions that will process the data and convert it to the format needed for further visualization.
3. Visualizing the data.

### Results
The resulting diagrams show the migraine dynamic over time as a plotline, while the periods are marked with color spans, with the timeline along the x axis and the headache intensity along the y axis.
